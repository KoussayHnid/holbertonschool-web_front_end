---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Accessibility Project --------------------------------------------------------
 This project demonstrates the implementation of web accessibility features in frontend development, ensuring that the website is inclusive and usable by individuals with a variety of disabilities.
 About :
The goal of this project is to create an accessible website that adheres to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards. It covers aspects like keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and color contrast to ensure the site is usable by people with visual, auditory, and motor impairments.

Features:
Semantic HTML: All page elements are properly structured with semantic HTML5 tags to improve accessibility for screen readers.
Keyboard Navigation: Users can navigate through the website using just the keyboard. Focus is clearly visible, and elements like buttons and links are accessible via the Tab key.
ARIA Support: Implemented ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles, states, and properties for better interaction with assistive technologies.
High Contrast and Readability: Text and elements meet the recommended contrast ratio for readability (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive and accessible on different screen sizes and devices.
Image Descriptions: All non-decorative images have descriptive alt attributes, making them understandable to screen readers.
Accessible Forms: Form inputs are labeled correctly to provide context for users with screen readers.
